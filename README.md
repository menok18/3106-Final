# 3106-Final
Baseball Data - PCA + Clustering + OLS using PCA + Lasso + Naive Bayes + Log Regression


This project analyzes the History of Baseball dataset off of Kaggle (the link to the dataset will be linked below). This project attempts to use a variety of of metrics that measure a teams performance throughout a given season in order to predict the probability that they win the World Series. This project engages in clustering and principal component analysis as means of exploratory analysis, and uses LASSO, Naive Bayes, PCA + OLS, and logarithmic regression as classification algorithms. Afterward, we compare the performance of these models against each other, comparing their precision and recall.
